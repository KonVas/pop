* POP

Code snippets for an interactive installation project using Arduino & SuperCollider.

** Software
1. SuperCollider (3.6 or later).
2. POP code: interface + synth.
3. Arduino: Firmata firmware.

** Hardware:
1. An Arduino board.

2. Two light sensors.

3.  One temperature sensor.

4.  A motion detector.

*** Instructions

First run the interface scd in SuperCollider, to start listening to the incoming data of the sensors and the arduino board. Once everything is up and running, shoot the synth (sound synthesis) document. Good luck.
